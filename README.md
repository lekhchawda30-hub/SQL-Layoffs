ðŸ“Š Data Cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis & Visualization (MySQL + Tableau)

ðŸš€ Project Overview

This project showcases the messy data transformed into a cleaned and visualised one

1. **Data Cleaning in MySQL** â€“ transformed raw, messy data into a structured, analysis-ready format.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in MySQL** â€“ used queries to uncover patterns, trends, and insights.
3. **Data Visualization in Tableau** â€“ built interactive dashboards to present insights effectively.



## ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies

* **Database:** MySQL
* **Visualization:** Tableau
* **Version Control:** GitHub

## ðŸ§¹ Data Cleaning Highlights (MySQL)

* Removed duplicate records
* Handled NULL and missing values
* Standardized inconsistent text fields (e.g., country names, job titles)
* Converted and validated data types (dates, numeric fields)
* Ensured overall dataset consistency

---

## ðŸ“Š Exploratory Data Analysis (MySQL)

Performed analysis to answer key business-style questions:

* Which regions/categories performed the best?
* Year-over-year growth and time trends
* Customer segmentation using `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`
* Advanced insights using joins and subqueries

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Data Visualization (Tableau)

Built **interactive dashboards** to present insights clearly:

* Cummulative layoffs over time
* regional analysis (layoffs by countries)
* Layoffs by stages and industries

## ðŸ”‘ Key Insights

* Cleaned messy raw dataset into a structured form for analysis.
* SQL queries revealed meaningful patterns and business insights.
* Tableau dashboards provided clear, interactive visualization for stakeholders.


Do you want me to also make you a **LinkedIn post draft** (short + engaging) that you can publish to announce this Tableau update and share the GitHub + Tableau links?
