Data Cleaning & Exploratory Data Analysis in MySQL

📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on cleaning raw data and performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) using **MySQL**.
The goal was to transform messy, inconsistent data into a structured format and then uncover useful insights.


 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

Database: MySQL

🧹Data Cleaning Process

Key cleaning steps performed:

* Removed duplicate records
* Handled NULL and missing values
* Standardized inconsistent text values (e.g., country names, job titles)
* Converted data types (dates, numeric fields) into proper formats
* Checked for outliers and incorrect entries

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Some of the analysis performed:

* Identified top categories/trends (e.g., by country, department, sales, etc.)
* Aggregated data using `GROUP BY` and `HAVING`
* Analyzed time trends using date functions
* Used subqueries and joins to extract deeper insights

📈 Key Insights

* Cleaned dataset became **analysis-ready** with consistent formatting.
* Discovered meaningful trends and patterns (e.g., top-performing regions/departments).
* Learned how SQL can be used for both **data cleaning** and **exploratory analysis**.
